The proceedings before Mance J lasted 25 days and led to a judgment extending to 174 pages in which the Judge carefully went through the points which had been argued before him Much of the time was taken up by submissions on behalf of the Defendants that there were no serious issues to be tried Save in respect of the claim of Torras London in the Wardbase transaction where the Judge held that Torras London had no arguable claim to have been the victim of a conspiracy or to have suffered loss he rejected those submissions We find it difficult to see how it could properly have been argued at such length that there was no serious issue to be tried See Seaconsar v Bank Markasi 1994 1 AC 438 at p455 where Lord Goff of Chieveley indicated that the issue of the merits should net be debated at length It was also contended on behalf of the Defendants that there had been material nondisclosure on the part of the Plaintiffs in obtaining leave under Order 11 Again the Judge rejected these submissions Neither of these two aspects of the case formed any part of the appeal The issues which are relevant to this appeal arose from the arguments of the Defendants under the Brussels Convention and Order 11 Under the Convention the Defendants advanced three argumentsnnFirst they argued that the object of the proceedings was the decisions of the organs of Grupo Torras and that Article 162 of the Convention required that the courts of Spain being the Contracting State in which Grupo Torras has its seat have exclusive jurisdiction If this argument succeeded the English court would wholly have to decline jurisdiction Secondly they argued that the proceedings involved the same cause of action and were between the same parties as proceedings which were pending before the Spanish courts and that Article 21 of the Convention required the English court to decline or at the least defer jurisdiction in favour of the Spanish courts as the English court was not the court first seized At the time that Mance J had to give his decision the European Court of Justice had not delivered its judgment in The Maciej Rataj C40692 6th December 1994 1994 EUECJ C40692 It is accepted that the effect of that judgment is that Article 21 only applies to the extent that the parties before the respective courts are the same and it does not prevent the proceedings from continuing between the other parties para34nnThe Defendants sought to rely alternatively or cumulatively upon two sets of Spanish proceedings One was begun by a querella filed by Grupo Torras on 8th January 1993 These proceedings are primarily criminal but in common with some other continental jurisdictions it is open to the court under Spanish procedural law within the ambit of those proceedings to give a civil judgment for compensation to be paid to a person who has suffered loss or injury as a result of conduct which the court has adjudged to be criminal There are various ways in which criminal proceedings may be instituted before the Spanish courts the querella is a form of complaint which is consistent with the court in due course exercising the power to give a civil judgment in favour of Grupo Torras It is however possible for the complainant to reserve the civil claim to be exercised separately The Defendants argued that for the purposes of Article 21 the parties to these Spanish criminal proceedings included Sheikh Fahad and messrs Jaffar de la Rosa de Mir Nunez Folchi and Soler They submitted that the English court should decline jurisdiction as between Grupo Torras and all these Defendants The other set of Spanish proceedings were the civil action originally filed by a Spanish company called Quail Espana SA in June 1992 against Grupo Torras Quail was owned and controlled by Messrs de la Rosa and de Mir and had a service agreement with Grupo Torras It took the form of a jactitation action alleging injurious falsehood on the part of Grupo Torras in relation to the performance of the agreement On 19th May these proceedings were amended to add as plaintiffs messrs de la Rosa de Mir Nunez Folchi and Soler and to claim declarations of regularity in relation to among other things the four transactions which by then were the subject of the English action This action has for convenience been referred to as the Quail action u The Defendants submit that the English court should also as between Grupo Torras and the Quail Plaintiffs decline jurisdiction in favour of the Spanish court The third argument of the Defendants was that the totality of the English action and the two Spanish proceedings were related actions that is to say actions which are so closely related that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments and the English court not being the court first seized should therefore apply Article 22 and stay the whole of the action This argument potentially applied to the whole of the action without making any distinction between the parties but like Article 21 only applies if the English court is not the court first seized The other points taken by the Defendants before the Judge were based upon Order 11 or the inherent jurisdiction Thus it was argued that England was not an appropriate forum and that Spain was the appropriate forum The Court should refuse to exercise its discretion under 011 and should stay the remainder of the proceedings The length of the proceedings before Mance J was further added to by the parties adducing extensive oral evidence from Spanish lawyers who were examined and crossexamined over a number of days The decision of the Judge was as we have said to reject subject to an immaterial qualification the applications of the Defendants He held that Article 162 did not apply He held that for a number of reasons neither of the Spanish proceedings came within the terms of Article 21 He held that the English court was the court first seized He accordingly held that Article 22 did not apply He held that England was in all the circumstances the appropriate forum for the trial of the various disputes raised by the action The Issues on the AppealnnThe arguments which are advanced on this appeal by the Defendants are nn1 That the Court should decline jurisdiction under Article 162 2 That Che Court should decline jurisdiction under Article 21 in relation to the common parties on the basis of na The Querella proceedingsnb The Quail action 3 That the Court should stay the action under Article 22 4 That if the Court accedes to the application under Article 21 or only accedes in part to the applications under Articles 162 or 22 the Court should decline to exercise its discretion under Oli or should stay the remainder of the action The Appellants did not therefore seek to challenge the exercise of the Judges discretion if he was right about Articles 162 21 and 22 u ChronologynnAs previously stated the application of these Articles requires that the court determine whether or not it is the court first seized it is therefore helpful at the outset to list the dates upon which steps were taken in the relevant actions this action in England and the criminal guerelJa proceedings and the Quail action in Spain 9692tOriginal Quail proceedings filedn26133tJudge Moreiras orders the noadmission of the criminal proceedings on the application of Mr de la Rosan19233tJudge Moreiras confirms nonadmission of the criminal proceedings after further intervention by Sheikh Fahad and Mr Jaffarn14493tEnglish writ issuedn15493tEnglish

admittedn29434tJudge Foncillas stays the Quail proceedings pending the resolution of the criminal proceedingsnThe Expert Evidence of Spanish LawnnA vast amount of evidence of Spanish law was adduced before the Judge On behalf of the Defendants Professor Rifa gave evidence in relation to the criminalcivil proceedings and Dr Carreras in relation to the Quail proceedings their written opinions and reports extend to 170 pages and their oral evidence extended over five days In reply Professor Ramos gave evidence on behalf of the Plaintiffs His reports extend to 190 pages and his oral evidence took four days It is evident that the Judge was greatly concerned at the inordinate time and expense involved in deciding the question of fact when would the Spanish Courts consider that the criminalcivil proceedings and the amended Quail proceedings were definitively pending for the purpose of Article 21 of the Convention But he found himself powerless to control the exuberance of the parties This question is not one that has so far confronted the Spanish Courts although they are familiar with the concept of lis alibi pendens for the purpose of domestic law The Judge made findings in relation to Spanish law and on the question of when the proceedings would be regarded as definitively pending The Appellants challenge his findings in relation to both the criminalcivil proceedings and also the amended Quail proceedings They also criticised the basis on which he had made his findings of fact regarding Spanish law They submitted that he had not had regard to the fact that Doth the content of the foreign law and how the foreign court would interpret and apply it were matters of evidence They said that he had substituted his own view for those of the expert witnesses and had been overinfluenced by English authority Questions of foreign law are questions of fact which must be proved to the satisfaction of the Judge If the evidence of expert witnesses conflicts it is the Judges duty to resolve these differences in the same way as he must in the case of other conflicting evidence of fact Bumper Corporation v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis 1991 1 WLR 1362 pl368FG u There is a similar provision in paragraph 5 for res judicata arising from an earlier judgment of a noncontracting state Title II of the Convention deals with jurisdiction This is a necessary corollary of Title III In particular provision is required to reduce the risk of conflicting judgments being given in different Contracting States and so raising problems for the mutual recognition of judgments Title II acknowledges that it is possible for the courts of more than one State to have jurisdiction in relation to a given matter and that an action may properly be commenced in the courts of more than one State Under Article 6 a defendant maybe joined in an action properly commenced in one Contracting State even though that defendant is domiciled in another State paral third party proceedings and counterclaims are permitted paras23 It is therefore possible that there may at one time be pending in the courts of more than one State actions which will give rise to the risk of inconsistent judgments either in the strict conflicts sense of res judicata or in a looser sense These are the subject of Articles 21 and 22 in Section 8 which is headed Lis pendens related actions Whilst the problem of conflicting judgments with which these two articles are dealing is the same the subject matter of the two articles is different Article 21 applies to proceedings involving the same cause of action and between the same parties Article 22 applies to related actions that is to say actions which whether or not they involve any of the same parties or causes of action should sensibly be tried together so as to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments It is only Article 21 which directly corresponds with article 273 This relationship was emphasised in Gubisch Maschinenfabrik KG v Giulio Palumbo 14486 1987 ECR 4861 the court stressed that Article 21 was concerned with lis pendens as defined in the article not as previously understood in the domestic law of any individual Contracting State Article 22 involves the exercise of a discretion in contrast the provisions of Article 21 are mandatory and require the relevant court to decline jurisdiction either immediately or ultimately But both articles adopt a common approach and apply the game criterion They apply a criterion of temporal priority and use the phrase the court first seized The court which is first seized is not affected and is entitled to proceed any other court is required to observe the requirements of the articles The meaning of the phrase the court first seized was considered in Zelger v Salinitri 12983 1984 ECR 2397 In different Contracting States different criteria existed for when an action became pending and submissions were made supported by the AdvocateGeneral that the Court should state at what point any action was to be considered to be pending for the purposes of Articles 21 and 22 for instance the moment the proceedings were served The Court reviewed the comparative material that had been placed before it and continuednn13 It follows from the comparison of the legislation mentioned above that a common concept of lis pendens cannot be arrived at by a rapprochement of the various relevant national provisions A fortiori therefore it is not possible to extend to all the contracting parties as is proposed by the plaintiff in the main action a concept which is peculiar to German law and which because of its characteristics cannot be transposed to the other legal systems concerned 14 It may properly be inferred from Article 21 read as a whole that a courts obligation to decline jurisdiction in favour of another court only comes into existence if it is established that proceedings have been definitively brought before a court in another State involving the same cause of action and between the same parties u That case concerned the carriage on the vessel the Tatry of various consignments of soya bean oil which had been discharged at Rotterdam and Hamburg contaminated it was said by diesel oil Various actions and crossactions in rem and in personam were commenced by or against three different groups of cargo owners by or against the carriers or one or other of their vessels in various courts in The Netherlands and England The questions referred to the Court by the English Court of Appeal included the question of the breadth of the phrases same cause of action and related actions one question directly raised the question how the phrase between the same parties in Article 21 was to be understood and applied The Court again linked the use of that phrase in Article 21 with its use in Article 273 and emphasised the need to construe the two provisions together The Court heldnn33 In the light of the wording of Article 21 of the Convention and the objective set out above that article must be understood as requiring as a condition of the obligation of the second court seised to decline jurisdiction that the parties to the two actions be identical 34 Consequently where some of the parties are the same as the parties to an action which has already been started Article 21 requires the second court seised to decline jurisdiction only to the extent to which the parties to the proceedings pending before it are also parties to the action previously started before the court of another Contracting state it does not prevent the proceedings from continuing between the other parties 35 Admittedly that interpretation of Article 21 involves fragmenting the proceedings However Article 22 mitigates that disadvantage That article allows the second court seised to stay proceedings or to decline jurisdiction on the ground that the actions are related if the conditions there set out are satisfied 36 Accordingly the answer to the first question is that on a proper construction of Article 21 of the Convention where two actions involve the same cause of action and some but not all of the parties to the second action are the same as the parties to the action commenced earlier in another Contracting State the second court seised is required to decline jurisdiction only to the extent to which the parties to the proceedings before it are also parties to the action previously commenced it does not prevent the proceedings from continuing between the other parties'
CONCLUSION: It follows that these appeals must be dismissed.'

IN THE COURT OF APPEAL
Royal Courts of Justice.
____________________
- and -
(1st Deft.)
WRIGHT (instructed by Messrs Baker & McKenzie, London EC4) appeared on behalf of the Respondents
____________________
The 15th to 20th Defendants are offshore companies provided by the professional advisers for the purpose, it is said, of carrying out the frauds
The Kuwait Investment Office {'KIO') is a branch of the Kuwait Investment Authority established in Kuwait and has as its function the management of investment of funds belonging to the Government of Kuwait
Torras London is a wholly owned subsidiary of Grupo Torras; at the material time it was substantially managed from Spain.
Until 26 May 1992 he was the chairman of Koolmees and Kokmeeuw and a director and President of Grupo Torras
Mr de Mir was a director of Grupo Torras and is said to have worked closely with Mr de la Rosa
He was not separately represented on the appeal, but adopted the submissions of the other appellants.
His position is on all fours with that of the 'Spanish Defendants'
(A) Those domiciled and served within the jurisdiction in accordance with Article 2 of the Convention Scheduled to the Civil Jurisdiction & Judgments Act 1982 as amended by the Civil Jurisdiction & Judgments Act 1982 (Amendment) Order 1990 (SI 1990 No
It is unnecessary to describe these transactions in detail
1
It is alleged that this payment was not for the benefit of the Plaintiffs.
It is then alleged that the payment was concealed by a series of sham documents and transactions, notably a sham loan agreement by Torras London to Croesus, with extensions, a guarantee of the 'loan' signed by Mr Nunez on behalf of Grupo Torras
The balance of the US $27.4 million, plus interest, was covered by a payment of US $2,576,707 by Torras London and later reimbursed by Grupo Torras to Torras London
2
As to the US $50 million, $10 million is said to have been traced to Mr Jaffar's Zurich Bank, $22.5 million to an account controlled by Sheikh Fahad in a bank in London and $15.49 million to the account of a company in Jersey of which Mr Russell is a signatory and whose address is the same as Russell Limebeer.
3
The US $300 million was not intended to be repaid by Pincinco from its own funds and was not paid to Pincinco for the benefit of Grupo Torras or Torras London
the Plaintiffs claim to have traced US $105 million of the Pincinco money to an account owned and controlled by Mr de la Rosa.
4
2 billion is said not to have been for the benefit of Torras London or Grupo Torras
The Plaintiffs' claim is based on conspiracy to injure, constructive trust and breach of duty by directors and officers of the Plaintiffs.
Much of the time was taken up by submissions on behalf of the Defendants that there were no serious issues to be tried
The issues which are relevant to this appeal arose from the arguments of the Defendants under the Brussels Convention and Order 11
First, they argued that the "object" of the proceedings was the "decisions of [the] organs" of Grupo Torras and that Article 16(2) of the Convention required that the courts of Spain, being the Contracting State in which Grupo Torras has its seat, have exclusive jurisdiction
Secondly they argued that the proceedings involved "the same cause of action" and were "between the same parties" as proceedings which were pending before the Spanish courts and that Article 21 of the Convention required the English court to decline, or at the least defer, jurisdiction in favour of the Spanish courts as the English court was not the court "first seized"
There are various ways in which criminal proceedings may be instituted before the Spanish courts; the querella is a form of complaint which is consistent with the court in due course exercising the power to give a civil judgment in favour of Grupo Torras
The Defendants submit that the English court should also, as between Grupo Torras and the Quail Plaintiffs, decline jurisdiction in favour of the Spanish court.
The third argument of the Defendants was that the totality of the English action and the two Spanish proceedings were "related" actions, that is to say, "actions which are so closely related that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments", and the English court, not being the court first seized, should therefore apply Article 22 and stay the whole of the action
The Court should refuse to exercise its discretion under 0.11 and should stay the remainder of the proceedings.
The length of the proceedings before Mance J was further added to by the parties adducing extensive oral evidence from Spanish lawyers who were examined and cross-examined over a number of days
They were prepared to submit to the jurisdiction of the Spanish court where that was necessary.
This is a question partly of European law (the Convention), partly of English procedural law (when was the English court seized of the action?) and partly a question of fact when under Spanish procedural law the Spanish courts became seized of the proceedings before them.
As a preliminary in this Court, the Appellants submitted that the Court should refer suggested questions of the construction of the Convention to the European Court for their opinion
Before Mance J, the Defendants submitted that a broad and purposive construction should be given to the Article, and in particular that the word 'validity' did not govern the words 'decisions of their organs'
It is accepted that the words "proceedings which have as their object" in this Article mean "proceedings which have as their subject-matter" or "proceedings which are principally concerned with"
There has, however, been debate about how the remainder of Article 16(2) should be read: whether it is concerned with proceedings which have as their subject-matter "the decisions of their organs" or "the validity of ..
We are, however, satisfied that it is not necessary for us to resolve the question on this appeal; we agree with the Judge that on either reading of the Article the present case clearly falls outside it.
The objective of Article 16(2) is to confer exclusive jurisdiction to decide questions concerning the constitution and internal management of a company on the courts of the Contracting State in which the company has its seat
The Appellants submit that Article 16(2) governs all questions which are concerned with the internal management of a company, and that this extends to all disputes which arise out of the relationship between the company and its officers or shareholders or between its shareholders and officers, and possibly even between its shareholders inter se
The powers of directors and other officers of a company are limited not only by formal or procedural requirements but also by the general principle that officers of a company must act .bona fide in the interests of the company
Honest but misguided directors who faithfully record their actions and purpose and, conducting themselves openly as the appropriate organ of the company, commit the company to a transaction which they mistakenly believe to be for its benefit, may be liable for acting beyond the scope of their authority if the transaction is not and could not reasonably be thought to be in the company's interest
The Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants, or those of them who were in a position to do so assisted by the others, misappropriated enormous sums of the Plaintiffs' money by procuring sums to be paid into offshore bank accounts set up to disguise the identity of the recipients, without the Plaintiffs receiving any benefit from the payments, and that they arranged for the true nature of the transactions to be concealed from the Plaintiffs and their auditors by a series of complicated but sham accounting transactions
What would have been in issue would have been, not the decisions of the organs, but the deceit of the Defendants in procuring those decisions to be made
The Appellants insist that the individual responsibilities of the principal Defendants consist in large measure of duties owed to Grupo Torras by its officers under Spanish law; the Plaintiffs have alleged the breach by the director defendants of their duties as directors
The Defendants argued that this capitalisation made good to Grupo Torras the loss it would otherwise have suffered on the Croesus, Oakthorn and Pincinco transactions and notwithstanding that the Defendants had (on the Plaintiffs' case) fraudulently deprived the Plaintiffs of the money advanced by Koolmees
But they have put forward no case of authorisation or ratification beyond alleging that what they did was done with the knowledge and approval of the First Defendant, whose own complicity in the fraud is evidenced by a substantial volume of material
The object of these proceedings is not decisions of the organs of Grupo Torras (nor, for that matter, of Torras London).
Article 16(2} does not debar the English courts from assuming jurisdiction in respect of the present action.
Where the jurisdiction of the court first seised is established, any court other than the court first seised shall decline jurisdiction in favour of that court.
19/2/33 Judge Moreiras confirms non-admission of the criminal proceedings ("after further intervention by Sheikh Fahad and Mr Jaffar
On behalf of the Defendants, Professor Rifa gave evidence in relation to the criminal/civil proceedings and Dr
The Judge made findings in relation to Spanish law and on the question of when the proceedings would be regarded as definitively pending
The Court of Appeal should in appropriate cases be more ready to question the judge's conclusions on an issue of foreign law than it is on other questions of fact
He set out his reasons for not applying Article 21 separately in relation to the Spanish criminal proceedings and in relation to the Quail action.
(b) if they had done, I would have been prepared to allow Grupo Torras to make a reservation in respect of the four transactions in the Spanish criminal proceedings;
" (i) the original and amended Quail proceedings fall to be regarded as separate proceedings for the purposes of Articles 21 and 22;
The provisions for the recognition and enforcement of judgments are contained in Title III of the Convention
"A judgment given in a Contracting State shall be recognised in the other Contracting states without any special procedure being required."
"If the judgment is irreconcilable with a judgment given in a dispute between the same parties in the State in which recognition is sought."
Title II acknowledges that it is possible for the courts of more than one State to have jurisdiction in relation to a given matter and that an action may properly be commenced in the courts of more than one State
Article 21 applies to "proceedings involving the same cause of action and between the same parties"; Article 22 applies to "related actions", that is to say actions which, whether or not they involve any of the same parties or causes of action, should sensibly be tried together so as to avoid the "risk of irreconcilable judgments"
The court which is first seized is not affected and is entitled to proceed; any other court is required to observe the requirements of the articles
The answer to the question raised by the Oberlandes-gericht Munchen is therefore that Article 21 of the Convention must be interpreted as meaning that the court "first seised" is the one before which the requirements for proceedings to become definitively pending are first fulfilled, such requirements to be determined in accordance with the national law of each of the courts concerned."
It is this test which in our judgment is decisive of the questions which arise in the present case
This is authority binding upon us, as it was on Mance J, that the present action was not definitively pending - that the English court was not seized of this action - until the writ had been served.
The Court again linked the use of that phrase in Article 21 with its use in Article 27(3) and emphasised the need to construe the two provisions together
Thus the Court held that a party by party approach must be adopted: to the extent that any of the parties in the relevant actions are the same, then Article 21 applies to those actions insofar as those actions are between those parties and not otherwise
The Appellants argued that Article 21, as construed in the Zelger and Maciej Ratal judgments, requires the question of definitive pendency to be answered party by party
However the Dresser judgment was not concerned with multiple parties; it was merely concerned to carry through into English procedural law the effect of the construction of Article 21 of the Convention upon which the European Court has spoken in Zelger
The Appellants, by contrast, sought to argue that the court first seized for the purpose of certain parties under Article 21 should necessarily be treated as the court first seized also for the purpose of Article 22, disregarding both the different subject matter and wording of Article 22 and the reductio ad absurdum to which this argument could give rise
The Respondents, relying upon the arguments to which we have referred, submitted that the date upon which the English court became seized of the present action was still, for the purposes of Article 21, 15th April 1993, the date upon which the first batch of Defendants were served
It is accepted for present purposes that the causes of action as between these parties are the same in the two actions
Nunez, in which case the Court would have to resolve the dispute as to the interpretation of Article 21 to which we have adverted
The Appellants submit that the correct finding is that the Spanish Courts were seized before 21st June 1993
(1) The Spanish courts became seized on 9th June 1992 because once the Quail proceedings had been amended (on 18th May 1993) the amendment related back under Spanish procedural law to the original date of filing and the date of filing is the date upon which a Spanish court becomes under Spanish procedural law seized of an action
In particular, they criticised his rejection of the filing date as the critical date under Spanish law and his adoption of the date of admission as being the relevant date.
It has been submitted to us that he failed to make a necessary distinction between what was involved in the admission of ordinary civil proceedings (like the Quail action) and the admission of criminal proceedings started by querella
It involves the Spanish court taking a positive view as to the regularity of the proceedings both procedurally and substantively
If admission is not to be adopted as the stage at which the Spanish civil court is to be treated as seized of the action for the purposes of the Convention, the choice lies between the date of filing and the date of service
The prior action has the status of being pending; it is treated as being the 'master' and the second action must defer to it
The Supreme Court held that priority should be given to the action which had been filed first; the exception of litispendencia could not be raised in that action.
However it is also clear, and it is accepted by the Appellants before us, that the exception cannot be taken until the proceedings in the action alleged to be the pending action (the lis pendens) have not only been filed but also admitted and served
"They [the witnesses] were on common ground that an exceptio could not be relied on without service of the allegedly earlier proceedings
"Thus under Spanish law the priority of two sets of civil proceedings will be determined by their dates of filing, assuming both to have been not only admitted but also served when the exceptio litispandencia is raised." (p
On the findings which the Appellants accept, it is clear that the requirements of Spanish law for an action to become definitively pending are that it has been filed, accepted and served
The Appellants had a related argument which, they said, led to the conclusion that the date of filing {whether of the original Quail proceedings or of the amendment) should be taken as the date of definitive pendency
Accordingly the ground of appeal which was founded on the submission that as between Grupo Torras and the Quail Plaintiffs, other than Mr
The proceedings are started by the filing of a guerella but that is followed by a substantive decision whether the proceedings are to be admitted
As at the end of June 1993, by which time all the relevant Defendants had been served with the -writ in the English action and the English action was on any view definitively pending, the status of the Spanish criminal proceedings was that Judge Moreiras had ruled that they should not be admitted
It is therefore unnecessary for us to enter upon any consideration of what would have been the potential impact of Article 22 upon related proceedings in this country and Spain.'
CONCLUSION: It follows that these appeals must be dismissed.'
