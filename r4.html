			<b>Summarization Text - Example</b>
			</br>
			The proceedings before Mance J lasted 25 days and led to a judgment extending to 174 pages in which the Judge carefully went through the points which had been argued before him Much of the time was taken up by submissions on behalf of the Defendants that there were no serious issues to be tried Save in respect of the claim of Torras London in the Wardbase transaction where the Judge held that Torras London had no arguable claim to have been the victim of a conspiracy or to have suffered loss he rejected those submissions We find it difficult to see how it could properly have been argued at such length that there was no serious issue to be tried See Seaconsar v Bank Markasi 1994 1 AC 438 at p455 where Lord Goff of Chieveley indicated that the issue of the merits should net be debated at length It was also contended on behalf of the Defendants that there had been material nondisclosure on the part of the Plaintiffs in obtaining leave under Order 11 Again the Judge rejected these submissions Neither of these two aspects of the case formed any part of the appeal The issues which are relevant to this appeal arose from the arguments of the Defendants under the Brussels Convention and Order 11 Under the Convention the Defendants advanced three argumentsnnFirst they argued that the object of the proceedings was the decisions of the organs of Grupo Torras and that Article 162 of the Convention required that the courts of Spain being the Contracting State in which Grupo Torras has its seat have exclusive jurisdiction If this argument succeeded the English court would wholly have to decline jurisdiction Secondly they argued that the proceedings involved the same cause of action and were between the same parties as proceedings which were pending before the Spanish courts and that Article 21 of the Convention required the English court to decline or at the least defer jurisdiction in favour of the Spanish courts as the English court was not the court first seized At the time that Mance J had to give his decision the European Court of Justice had not delivered its judgment in The Maciej Rataj C40692 6th December 1994 1994 EUECJ C40692 It is accepted that the effect of that judgment is that Article 21 only applies to the extent that the parties before the respective courts are the same and it does not prevent the proceedings from continuing between the other parties para34nnThe Defendants sought to rely alternatively or cumulatively upon two sets of Spanish proceedings One was begun by a querella filed by Grupo Torras on 8th January 1993 These proceedings are primarily criminal but in common with some other continental jurisdictions it is open to the court under Spanish procedural law within the ambit of those proceedings to give a civil judgment for compensation to be paid to a person who has suffered loss or injury as a result of conduct which the court has adjudged to be criminal There are various ways in which criminal proceedings may be instituted before the Spanish courts the querella is a form of complaint which is consistent with the court in due course exercising the power to give a civil judgment in favour of Grupo Torras It is however possible for the complainant to reserve the civil claim to be exercised separately The Defendants argued that for the purposes of Article 21 the parties to these Spanish criminal proceedings included Sheikh Fahad and messrs Jaffar de la Rosa de Mir Nunez Folchi and Soler They submitted that the English court should decline jurisdiction as between Grupo Torras and all these Defendants The other set of Spanish proceedings were the civil action originally filed by a Spanish company called Quail Espana SA in June 1992 against Grupo Torras Quail was owned and controlled by Messrs de la Rosa and de Mir and had a service agreement with Grupo Torras It took the form of a jactitation action alleging injurious falsehood on the part of Grupo Torras in relation to the performance of the agreement On 19th May these proceedings were amended to add as plaintiffs messrs de la Rosa de Mir Nunez Folchi and Soler and to claim declarations of regularity in relation to among other things the four transactions which by then were the subject of the English action This action has for convenience been referred to as the Quail action u The Defendants submit that the English court should also as between Grupo Torras and the Quail Plaintiffs decline jurisdiction in favour of the Spanish court The third argument of the Defendants was that the totality of the English action and the two Spanish proceedings were related actions that is to say actions which are so closely related that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments and the English court not being the court first seized should therefore apply Article 22 and stay the whole of the action This argument potentially applied to the whole of the action without making any distinction between the parties but like Article 21 only applies if the English court is not the court first seized The other points taken by the Defendants before the Judge were based upon Order 11 or the inherent jurisdiction Thus it was argued that England was not an appropriate forum and that Spain was the appropriate forum The Court should refuse to exercise its discretion under 011 and should stay the remainder of the proceedings The length of the proceedings before Mance J was further added to by the parties adducing extensive oral evidence from Spanish lawyers who were examined and crossexamined over a number of days The decision of the Judge was as we have said to reject subject to an immaterial qualification the applications of the Defendants He held that Article 162 did not apply He held that for a number of reasons neither of the Spanish proceedings came within the terms of Article 21 He held that the English court was the court first seized He accordingly held that Article 22 did not apply He held that England was in all the circumstances the appropriate forum for the trial of the various disputes raised by the action The Issues on the AppealnnThe arguments which are advanced on this appeal by the Defendants are nn1 That the Court should decline jurisdiction under Article 162 2 That Che Court should decline jurisdiction under Article 21 in relation to the common parties on the basis of na The Querella proceedingsnb The Quail action 3 That the Court should stay the action under Article 22 4 That if the Court accedes to the application under Article 21 or only accedes in part to the applications under Articles 162 or 22 the Court should decline to exercise its discretion under Oli or should stay the remainder of the action The Appellants did not therefore seek to challenge the exercise of the Judges discretion if he was right about Articles 162 21 and 22 u ChronologynnAs previously stated the application of these Articles requires that the court determine whether or not it is the court first seized it is therefore helpful at the outset to list the dates upon which steps were taken in the relevant actions this action in England and the criminal guerelJa proceedings and the Quail action in Spain 9692tOriginal Quail proceedings filedn26133tJudge Moreiras orders the noadmission of the criminal proceedings on

admittedn29434tJudge Foncillas stays the Quail proceedings pending the resolution of the criminal proceedingsnThe Expert Evidence of Spanish LawnnA vast amount of evidence of Spanish law was adduced before the Judge On behalf of the Defendants Professor Rifa gave evidence in relation to the criminalcivil proceedings and Dr Carreras in relation to the Quail proceedings their written opinions and reports extend to 170 pages and their oral evidence extended over five days In reply Professor Ramos gave evidence on behalf of the Plaintiffs His reports extend to 190 pages and his oral evidence took four days It is evident that the Judge was greatly concerned at the inordinate time and expense involved in deciding the question of fact when would the Spanish Courts consider that the criminalcivil proceedings and the amended Quail proceedings were definitively pending for the purpose of Article 21 of the Convention But he found himself powerless to control the exuberance of the parties This question is not one that has so far confronted the Spanish Courts although they are familiar with the concept of lis alibi pendens for the purpose of domestic law The Judge made findings in relation to Spanish law and on the question of when the proceedings would be regarded as definitively pending The Appellants challenge his findings in relation to both the criminalcivil proceedings and also the amended Quail proceedings They also criticised the basis on which he had made his findings of fact regarding Spanish law They submitted that he had not had regard to the fact that Doth the content of the foreign law and how the foreign court would interpret and apply it were matters of evidence They said that he had substituted his own view for those of the expert witnesses and had been overinfluenced by English authority Questions of foreign law are questions of fact which must be proved to the satisfaction of the Judge If the evidence of expert witnesses conflicts it is the Judges duty to resolve these differences in the same way as he must in the case of other conflicting evidence of fact Bumper Corporation v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis 1991 1 WLR 1362 pl368FG u There is a similar provision in paragraph 5 for res judicata arising from an earlier judgment of a noncontracting state Title II of the Convention deals with jurisdiction This is a necessary corollary of Title III In particular provision is required to reduce the risk of conflicting judgments being given in different Contracting States and so raising problems for the mutual recognition of judgments Title II acknowledges that it is possible for the courts of more than one State to have jurisdiction in relation to a given matter and that an action may properly be commenced in the courts of more than one State Under Article 6 a defendant maybe joined in an action properly commenced in one Contracting State even though that defendant is domiciled in another State paral third party proceedings and counterclaims are permitted paras23 It is therefore possible that there may at one time be pending in the courts of more than one State actions which will give rise to the risk of inconsistent judgments either in the strict conflicts sense of res judicata or in a looser sense These are the subject of Articles 21 and 22 in Section 8 which is headed Lis pendens related actions Whilst the problem of conflicting judgments with which these two articles are dealing is the same the subject matter of the two articles is different Article 21 applies to proceedings involving the same cause of action and between the same parties Article 22 applies to related actions that is to say actions which whether or not they involve any of the same parties or causes of action should sensibly be tried together so as to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments It is only Article 21 which directly corresponds with article 273 This relationship was emphasised in Gubisch Maschinenfabrik KG v Giulio Palumbo 14486 1987 ECR 4861 the court stressed that Article 21 was concerned with lis pendens as defined in the article not as previously understood in the domestic law of any individual Contracting State Article 22 involves the exercise of a discretion in contrast the provisions of Article 21 are mandatory and require the relevant court to decline jurisdiction either immediately or ultimately But both articles adopt a common approach and apply the game criterion They apply a criterion of temporal priority and use the phrase the court first seized The court which is first seized is not affected and is entitled to proceed any other court is required to observe the requirements of the articles The meaning of the phrase the court first seized was considered in Zelger v Salinitri 12983 1984 ECR 2397 In different Contracting States different criteria existed for when an action became pending and submissions were made supported by the AdvocateGeneral that the Court should state at what point any action was to be considered to be pending for the purposes of Articles 21 and 22 for instance the moment the proceedings were served The Court reviewed the comparative material that had been placed before it and continuednn13 It follows from the comparison of the legislation mentioned above that a common concept of lis pendens cannot be arrived at by a rapprochement of the various relevant national provisions A fortiori therefore it is not possible to extend to all the contracting parties as is proposed by the plaintiff in the main action a concept which is peculiar to German law and which because of its characteristics cannot be transposed to the other legal systems concerned 14 It may properly be inferred from Article 21 read as a whole that a courts obligation to decline jurisdiction in favour of another court only comes into existence if it is established that proceedings have been definitively brought before a court in another State involving the same cause of action and between the same parties u That case concerned the carriage on the vessel the Tatry of various consignments of soya bean oil which had been discharged at Rotterdam and Hamburg contaminated it was said by diesel oil Various actions and crossactions in rem and in personam were commenced by or against three different groups of cargo owners by or against the carriers or one or other of their vessels in various courts in The Netherlands and England The questions referred to the Court by the English Court of Appeal included the question of the breadth of the phrases same cause of action and related actions one question directly raised the question how the phrase between the same parties in Article 21 was to be understood and applied The Court again linked the use of that phrase in Article 21 with its use in Article 273 and emphasised the need to construe the two provisions together The Court heldnn33 In the light of the wording of Article 21 of the Convention and the objective set out above that article must be understood as requiring as a condition of the obligation of the second court seised to decline jurisdiction that the parties to the two actions be identical 34 Consequently where some of the parties are the same as the parties to an action which has already been started Article 21 requires the second court seised to decline jurisdiction only to the extent to which the parties to the proceedings pending before it are also parties to the action previously started before the court of another Contracting state it does not prevent the proceedings from continuing between the other parties 35 Admittedly that interpretation of Article 21 involves fragmenting the proceedings However Article 22 mitigates that disadvantage That article allows the second court seised to stay proceedings or to decline jurisdiction on the ground that the actions are related if the conditions there set out are satisfied 36 Accordingly the answer to the first question is that on a proper construction of Article 21 of the Convention where two actions involve the same cause of action and some but not all of the parties to the second action are the same as the parties to the action commenced earlier in another Contracting State the second court seised is required to decline jurisdiction only to the extent to which the parties to the proceedings before it are also parties to the action previously commenced it does not prevent the proceedings from continuing between the other parties'
CONCLUSION: It follows that these appeals must be dismissed.'
